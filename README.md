# Custom Serializers in DRF

This concept page explores the **advanced capabilities** of Django REST Framework (DRF) serializers. It covers how to create **custom serializers** that handle **complex data structures**, implement **custom validation rules**, and nest serializers for **related objects**.

## Concept Overview

While DRF provides convenient serializers like `ModelSerializer` and `HyperlinkedModelSerializer`, building **custom serializers** offers greater **flexibility** and **control** over data representation and validation. This concept explores **advanced customization techniques**, enabling you to tailor serializers to your specific API requirements and handle **intricate data structures** with ease.

## Topics

- **Customizing Serializers**
- **Validation in Serializers**
- **Nested Serializers for Related Objects**

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to **extend and customize serializers** in DRF
- Implement **custom validation rules** in serializers
- Learn to use **nested serializers** to handle related objects

---

## Customizing Serializers

While the default serializers provided by DRF are **powerful** and **flexible**, there are often cases where you need to **customize** the serialization and deserialization process to meet the specific requirements of your API.

DRF allows you to **extend and customize serializers** in a variety of ways, such as:

- **Adding custom fields**: You can add custom fields to your serializer that are not directly mapped to model fields.
- **Overriding default behavior**: You can override the default serialization and deserialization logic to implement custom logic.
- **Handling complex data structures**: Serializers can handle nested data structures, such as **one-to-many** or **many-to-many** relationships.

Here’s an example of a **customized serializer** that includes a custom field:

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import BlogPost, Comment

class CommentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    author_name = serializers.CharField(source='author.username', read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = Comment
        fields = ['id', 'content', 'author', 'author_name', 'created_at']
```
````

In this example, the `CommentSerializer` includes a **custom `author_name` field** that displays the username of the comment’s author.

---

## Validation in Serializers

Serializers can also be used to **validate incoming data** before creating or updating model instances. You can define **custom validation rules** by overriding the `validate` method in your serializer.

Here’s an example:

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import BlogPost

class BlogPostSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = BlogPost
        fields = ['id', 'title', 'content', 'author', 'created_at']

    def validate(self, data):
        if len(data['title']) < 5:
            raise serializers.ValidationError("Title must be at least 5 characters long.")
        return data
```

In this example, the `validate` method checks if the `title` field in the incoming data is at least 5 characters long. If the validation fails, a `ValidationError` is raised, which will be returned to the client in the response.

---

## Nested Serializers for Related Objects

Serializers can also be used to handle **relationships between models**, such as **one-to-many** or **many-to-many** relationships. This is done by **nesting serializers** within other serializers.

Here’s an example:

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import BlogPost, Comment

class CommentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Comment
        fields = ['id', 'content', 'author', 'created_at']

class BlogPostSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    comments = CommentSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = BlogPost
        fields = ['id', 'title', 'content', 'author', 'comments', 'created_at']
```

In this example, the `BlogPostSerializer` includes a `comments` field that is a **nested `CommentSerializer`**. This allows the API to return the blog post data along with its related comments.

---

## Practice Exercise

1. Create a **custom serializer** for a `User` model that includes a `full_name` field, calculated from the `first_name` and `last_name` fields.
2. Modify the `BlogPostSerializer` to allow creating and updating blog posts with related comments. Implement validation to ensure the comment author is the same as the blog post author.
3. Add a **custom action** to the `BlogPostViewSet` that allows users to “like” a blog post, and update the `BlogPostSerializer` to include the number of likes for each post.

# Custom Views with DRF Generics and Mixins

## Concept Overview

This concept page explores the concept of **custom views** with **generics** and **mixins**. Before we dive into it, let’s remind ourselves what these terms mean.

- **View**: A function that takes a web request and returns a response. Basically, the connection between the client and the server.
- **Generic Views**: These are provided by the **Django REST Framework (DRF)** and allow you to quickly build API views that map closely to the database models.
- **Mixins**: These are reusable pieces of code that add functionality to views. Instead of directly defining methods like `.get()` or `.post()` in your views, you can use these mixins to add specific actions.

That said, in this reading session, we will learn more about leveraging **generics** and **mixins** on **custom views**.

## Topics

- **Custom Views with Mixins**
- **Custom Views with Generics**

---

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to create **custom views**.
- Understand how to create **custom views** with DRF’s **generics**.
- Understand how to create **custom views** with **mixins**.

---

## Custom Views with DRF’s Generics

**Generic views** in DRF are classes that encapsulate common patterns for **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations. These views provide default implementations for handling HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`. They abstract away repetitive code and promote **code reuse**.

To create **custom views** with DRF’s generics, you need to define a class that inherits from the `GenericAPIView` class. This class extends from the `APIView` class, adding commonly required behavior for standard **list** and **detail** views.

Here is an example of **custom views with generics**:

```python
from rest_framework import generics
from .models import Book  # Replace with your working model
from .serializers import BookSerializer  # Replace with your project's serializer

class CustomBookCreateView(generics.CreateAPIView):
    # Can be any name, ensure to align with your project as this is a sample example
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer

class CustomBookListView(generics.ListAPIView):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer
```
````

## Custom Views with Mixins

**Mixins** are reusable components that can be combined with **generic views** to add specific behaviors, such as **authentication**, **permission checks**, or **custom logic**.

To implement **mixins** in Django, you can create a separate class for each mixin and then inherit it within the class where you want to incorporate the functionality. For instance, to utilize the `LoginRequiredMixin` in a view, you would define the mixin like this:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin
from django.views import View

class MyView(LoginRequiredMixin, View):
    login_url = '/login/'
    redirect_field_name = 'redirect_to'

    def get(self, request):
        # Your view logic here
```
