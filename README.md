# Custom Serializers in DRF

This concept page explores the **advanced capabilities** of Django REST Framework (DRF) serializers. It covers how to create **custom serializers** that handle **complex data structures**, implement **custom validation rules**, and nest serializers for **related objects**.

## Concept Overview

While DRF provides convenient serializers like `ModelSerializer` and `HyperlinkedModelSerializer`, building **custom serializers** offers greater **flexibility** and **control** over data representation and validation. This concept explores **advanced customization techniques**, enabling you to tailor serializers to your specific API requirements and handle **intricate data structures** with ease.

## Topics

- **Customizing Serializers**
- **Validation in Serializers**
- **Nested Serializers for Related Objects**

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to **extend and customize serializers** in DRF
- Implement **custom validation rules** in serializers
- Learn to use **nested serializers** to handle related objects

---

## Customizing Serializers

While the default serializers provided by DRF are **powerful** and **flexible**, there are often cases where you need to **customize** the serialization and deserialization process to meet the specific requirements of your API.

DRF allows you to **extend and customize serializers** in a variety of ways, such as:

- **Adding custom fields**: You can add custom fields to your serializer that are not directly mapped to model fields.
- **Overriding default behavior**: You can override the default serialization and deserialization logic to implement custom logic.
- **Handling complex data structures**: Serializers can handle nested data structures, such as **one-to-many** or **many-to-many** relationships.

Here’s an example of a **customized serializer** that includes a custom field:

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import BlogPost, Comment

class CommentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    author_name = serializers.CharField(source='author.username', read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = Comment
        fields = ['id', 'content', 'author', 'author_name', 'created_at']
```
````

In this example, the `CommentSerializer` includes a **custom `author_name` field** that displays the username of the comment’s author.

---

## Validation in Serializers

Serializers can also be used to **validate incoming data** before creating or updating model instances. You can define **custom validation rules** by overriding the `validate` method in your serializer.

Here’s an example:

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import BlogPost

class BlogPostSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = BlogPost
        fields = ['id', 'title', 'content', 'author', 'created_at']

    def validate(self, data):
        if len(data['title']) < 5:
            raise serializers.ValidationError("Title must be at least 5 characters long.")
        return data
```

In this example, the `validate` method checks if the `title` field in the incoming data is at least 5 characters long. If the validation fails, a `ValidationError` is raised, which will be returned to the client in the response.

---

## Nested Serializers for Related Objects

Serializers can also be used to handle **relationships between models**, such as **one-to-many** or **many-to-many** relationships. This is done by **nesting serializers** within other serializers.

Here’s an example:

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import BlogPost, Comment

class CommentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Comment
        fields = ['id', 'content', 'author', 'created_at']

class BlogPostSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    comments = CommentSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = BlogPost
        fields = ['id', 'title', 'content', 'author', 'comments', 'created_at']
```

In this example, the `BlogPostSerializer` includes a `comments` field that is a **nested `CommentSerializer`**. This allows the API to return the blog post data along with its related comments.

---

## Practice Exercise

1. Create a **custom serializer** for a `User` model that includes a `full_name` field, calculated from the `first_name` and `last_name` fields.
2. Modify the `BlogPostSerializer` to allow creating and updating blog posts with related comments. Implement validation to ensure the comment author is the same as the blog post author.
3. Add a **custom action** to the `BlogPostViewSet` that allows users to “like” a blog post, and update the `BlogPostSerializer` to include the number of likes for each post.

# Custom Views with DRF Generics and Mixins

## Concept Overview

This concept page explores the concept of **custom views** with **generics** and **mixins**. Before we dive into it, let’s remind ourselves what these terms mean.

- **View**: A function that takes a web request and returns a response. Basically, the connection between the client and the server.
- **Generic Views**: These are provided by the **Django REST Framework (DRF)** and allow you to quickly build API views that map closely to the database models.
- **Mixins**: These are reusable pieces of code that add functionality to views. Instead of directly defining methods like `.get()` or `.post()` in your views, you can use these mixins to add specific actions.

That said, in this reading session, we will learn more about leveraging **generics** and **mixins** on **custom views**.

---

## Topics

- **Custom Views with Mixins**
- **Custom Views with Generics**

---

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to create **custom views**.
- Understand how to create **custom views** with DRF’s **generics**.
- Understand how to create **custom views** with **mixins**.

---

## Custom Views with DRF’s Generics

**Generic views** in DRF are classes that encapsulate common patterns for **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations. These views provide default implementations for handling HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`. They abstract away repetitive code and promote **code reuse**.

To create **custom views** with DRF’s generics, you need to define a class that inherits from the `GenericAPIView` class. This class extends from the `APIView` class, adding commonly required behavior for standard **list** and **detail** views.

Here is an example of **custom views with generics**:

```python
from rest_framework import generics
from .models import Book  # Replace with your working model
from .serializers import BookSerializer  # Replace with your project's serializer

class CustomBookCreateView(generics.CreateAPIView):
    # Can be any name, ensure to align with your project as this is a sample example
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer

class CustomBookListView(generics.ListAPIView):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer
```
````

---

## Custom Views with Mixins

**Mixins** are reusable components that can be combined with **generic views** to add specific behaviors, such as **authentication**, **permission checks**, or **custom logic**.

To implement **mixins** in Django, you can create a separate class for each mixin and then inherit it within the class where you want to incorporate the functionality. For instance, to utilize the `LoginRequiredMixin` in a view, you would define the mixin like this:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin
from django.views import View

class MyView(LoginRequiredMixin, View):
    login_url = '/login/'
    redirect_field_name = 'redirect_to'

    def get(self, request):
        # Your view logic here
```

# Filtering, Searching, and Ordering in DRF

## Concept Overview

In this concept, we will dive deep into the context of **API filtering** in the **Django REST Framework (DRF)**. **Filtering** is simply the process of adding restrictions to a particular queryset. For example, if you have a list of users with different roles (e.g., teachers, doctors, engineers) and you would like to get data for only teachers, you use **filtering** to get a queryset of only teachers.

This can look like:

```python
return Users.objects.filter(role=Teachers)
```
````

---

## Filtering

In DRF, the simplest way to filter the queryset of any view that subclasses the `GenericAPIView` is to override the `.get_queryset()` method. Doing so allows you to customize the queryset returned by the view in a number of different ways.

Let’s jump into some examples:

### **Filtering Against the Current User**

This is relevant when you want to get data relevant to the **currently authenticated user**. This can be done based on the value of `request.user`.

```python
from myapp.models import Purchase
from myapp.serializers import PurchaseSerializer
from rest_framework import generics

class PurchaseList(generics.ListAPIView):
    serializer_class = PurchaseSerializer

    def get_queryset(self):
        """
        This view should return a list of all the purchases
        for the currently authenticated user.
        """
        user = self.request.user
        return Purchase.objects.filter(purchaser=user)
```

### **Filtering Against the URL**

This involves restricting the queryset based on some parts of the URL. For instance, if your URL configuration includes an entry like this:

```python
re_path('^purchases/(?P<username>.+)/$', PurchaseList.as_view()),
```

You can create a view that filters the purchase queryset based on the `username` from the URL:

```python
class PurchaseList(generics.ListAPIView):
    serializer_class = PurchaseSerializer

    def get_queryset(self):
        """
        This view returns a list of purchases for the user specified in the URL.
        """
        username = self.kwargs['username']
        return Purchase.objects.filter(purchaser__username=username)
```

### **Filtering Against Query Parameters**

Another example of filtering involves determining the initial queryset based on **query parameters** in the URL.

For instance, we can override `.get_queryset()` to handle URLs like `http://example.com/api/purchases?username=denvercoder9`, filtering the queryset only if the `username` parameter is present in the URL:

```python
class PurchaseList(generics.ListAPIView):
    serializer_class = PurchaseSerializer

    def get_queryset(self):
        """
        Optionally restricts the returned purchases to a specific user,
        by filtering based on the `username` query parameter in the URL.
        """
        queryset = Purchase.objects.all()
        username = self.request.query_params.get('username')
        if username is not None:
            queryset = queryset.filter(purchaser__username=username)
        return queryset
```

---

## Searching

DRF offers a filter called **`SearchFilter`** for queryset filtering based on a query parameter named `search`. This class will only be applied if the view has a `search_fields` attribute set. The `search_fields` attribute should be a list of names of text-type fields on the model, such as `CharField` or `TextField`.

For example:

```python
from rest_framework import filters

class UserListView(generics.ListAPIView):
    queryset = User.objects.all()
    serializer_class = UserSerializer
    filter_backends = [filters.SearchFilter]
    search_fields = ['username', 'email']
```

This allows the client to filter the items in the list by making queries such as:

```
http://example.com/api/users?search=russell
```

---

## Ordering

Ordering is important when it comes to controlling the **order of results**. This is supported by the **`OrderingFilter`** class. For example, to order users by `username`:

```
http://example.com/api/users?ordering=username
```

The client may also specify **reverse orderings** by prefixing the field name with `-`, like so:

```
http://example.com/api/users?ordering=-username
```

Multiple orderings may also be specified:

```
http://example.com/api/users?ordering=account,username
```

It’s recommended that you explicitly specify which fields the API should allow in the ordering filter. You can do this by setting an `ordering_fields` attribute on the view, like so:

```python
class UserListView(generics.ListAPIView):
    queryset = User.objects.all()
    serializer_class = UserSerializer
    filter_backends = [filters.OrderingFilter]
    ordering_fields = ['username', 'email']
```

### Key Highlights

- **Filtering**: Restricting querysets based on conditions (e.g., current user, URL parameters, query parameters).
- **Searching**: Using `SearchFilter` to filter querysets based on text fields.
- **Ordering**: Using `OrderingFilter` to control the order of results.
- **Best Practices**: Explicitly define `search_fields` and `ordering_fields` for clarity and security.

# Testing DRF APIs

## Concept Overview

> **“Code without tests is broken as designed.”**

Testing is an **integral part of software development**, crucial for ensuring the **reliability**, **functionality**, and **maintainability** of applications. In this concept page, we delve into the significance of testing within the **Django Rest Framework (DRF)** environment, focusing on **testing API endpoints**, **unit tests**, and **best practices** for ensuring robust application development.

---

## Testing in DRF: API Endpoints

In DRF, testing API endpoints is streamlined through the utilization of the **`rest_framework.test`** library, which offers a comprehensive suite of classes and methods tailored for this purpose. A key component of this library is the **`APIRequestFactory`**, which mirrors Django’s `RequestFactory` and facilitates the simulation of HTTP requests to API endpoints.

### Example: Using `APIRequestFactory`

```python
from rest_framework.test import APIRequestFactory

# Using the standard RequestFactory API to create a form POST request
factory = APIRequestFactory()
request = factory.post('/notes/', {'title': 'new idea'})
```

This snippet illustrates how **`APIRequestFactory`** enables the testing of API endpoints, such as the ability to create notes. Similar methods like `.get()`, `.put()`, `.patch()`, `.delete()`, `.head()`, and `.options()` can be utilized for comprehensive testing of various HTTP methods.

---

## Unit Tests

Django’s unit testing framework relies on the Python standard library module **`unittest`**. By subclassing **`django.test.TestCase`**, which extends **`unittest.TestCase`**, developers can create test cases that run within a **transactional environment**, ensuring **database isolation**.

### Example: Unit Test for a Model

```python
from django.test import TestCase
from myapp.models import Animal

class AnimalTestCase(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Create test data
        Animal.objects.create(name="lion", sound="roar")
        Animal.objects.create(name="cat", sound="meow")

    def test_animals_can_speak(self):
        """Animals that can speak are correctly identified"""
        lion = Animal.objects.get(name="lion")
        cat = Animal.objects.get(name="cat")
        self.assertEqual(lion.speak(), 'The lion says "roar"')
        self.assertEqual(cat.speak(), 'The cat says "meow"')
```

This example demonstrates how **unit tests** can verify the behavior of models, ensuring that expected actions produce desired outcomes.

---

## Best Practices for Testing in DRF

1. **Test All Endpoints**:
   - Ensure that all API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) are tested for both **success** and **failure** scenarios.

2. **Use `APITestCase` for API Testing**:
   - DRF provides **`APITestCase`**, which extends Django’s `TestCase` and includes additional functionality for testing APIs.

   ```python
   from rest_framework.test import APITestCase
   from rest_framework import status

   class NoteAPITestCase(APITestCase):
       def test_create_note(self):
           url = '/notes/'
           data = {'title': 'new idea'}
           response = self.client.post(url, data, format='json')
           self.assertEqual(response.status_code, status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
   ```

3. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Test for invalid inputs, missing fields, and unauthorized access.

   ```python
   def test_create_note_with_invalid_data(self):
       url = '/notes/'
       data = {}  # Missing 'title' field
       response = self.client.post(url, data, format='json')
       self.assertEqual(response.status_code, status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
   ```

4. **Use Factories for Test Data**:
   - Use libraries like **`factory_boy`** to create test data efficiently.

   ```python
   import factory
   from myapp.models import Animal

   class AnimalFactory(factory.django.DjangoModelFactory):
       class Meta:
           model = Animal

       name = "lion"
       sound = "roar"
   ```

5. **Test Performance**:
   - Use tools like **`django-silk`** or **`pytest-benchmark`** to test the performance of your API endpoints.

---

## Additional Notes

### **Why Testing is Important**
- **Identifies Bugs Early**: Testing helps catch issues before they reach production.
- **Improves Code Quality**: Writing tests forces you to write cleaner, more modular code.
- **Facilitates Refactoring**: Tests ensure that changes don’t break existing functionality.
- **Builds Confidence**: A well-tested application is more reliable and easier to maintain.

### **Types of Tests**
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components (e.g., models, views).
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components (e.g., API endpoints).
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test the entire application workflow.

## Example: Testing API Endpoints with `APIClient`

DRF provides **`APIClient`**, which is a wrapper around Django’s `Client` class and is specifically designed for testing APIs.

```python
from rest_framework.test import APIClient
from rest_framework import status

client = APIClient()

# Test GET request
response = client.get('/notes/')
assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK

# Test POST request
data = {'title': 'new idea'}
response = client.post('/notes/', data, format='json')
assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_201_CREATED
```

---

## Example: Testing Authentication

If your API requires authentication, you can use **`force_authenticate`** to simulate authenticated requests.

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from rest_framework.test import APIClient

client = APIClient()
user = User.objects.create_user(username='testuser', password='testpass')
client.force_authenticate(user=user)

response = client.get('/protected-endpoint/')
assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
```

---

## Example: Testing Pagination

If your API uses pagination, you can test the paginated response.

```python
response = client.get('/notes/?page=2')
assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
assert 'results' in response.data
assert len(response.data['results']) == 10  # Assuming page size is 10
```

---

By following these **testing methodologies**, developers can enhance the **reliability** and **stability** of their DRF applications, facilitating efficient management in production environments. Testing not only identifies and prevents potential issues but also fosters confidence in the application’s functionality, ultimately leading to a **superior user experience**.
